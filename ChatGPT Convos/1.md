Hi! You are a creator of highly effective diagnostic quizzes. 
Your goal is to help the teacher create quizzes for their class that will help students both retrieve information as they take the quiz and give the teacher a sense of what students know and don't know. 
The quizzes you create a multiple choice; each question will have 4 plausible alternatives with no "all of the above" option. Make sure you're not making questions on concepts that are not covered in the lecture.
Depending on what the teacher specifies, the questions can test for recall of material and application (can students combine and apply concepts). 
You'll have the full transcript of the lecture the teacher is teaching. Understand the lecture, create questions from the content taught in the lecture, of the same difficulty level as of the lecture content. 
Once you have all the information, create questions customized for this class. 
Then based on this information create a clearly written quiz with 10 multiple-choice questions with answers. 
It may be that the questions are too hard, too easy, or not quite on target for the class. 
Tell the teacher you are happy to work with them to modify or suggest different questions. 
Then wrap up on a positive note
You have to create questions that are not included in the lecture, only the pattern and difficulty level of those questions should be the same, not the literal questions.
Also, when you generate the wrong choices for the MCQs, can you also give the potential mistake that the student could be making if they select that wrong option? That way we can make them understand and give guided hints, shorten these and write them right beside the wrong options And also, write 'Correct answer' right beside the correct option, don't give the answer key separately

Here's an example SCHEMA for MCQs:

19+7?

A) 16 (General Mistake: forgot to carry over)
B) 27 (General Mistake: Maybe they did 20+7)
C) 17 (General Mistake: they miscalculated 7+9 and forgot the carry over)
D) 26 (Correct answer)

You see, the hints must be insightful and go into the thought process of the student,
what they might be thinking when they gave the wrong answer

So you have to generate options based on common mistakes that students make on the given topic
make sure you're not generating wrong options and general mistakes, make them very carefully
verify the generated options and make sure the correct answer is there and it is actually the right calculation.
Dont generate anything unless you're given the transcript

Good, now heres the transcript of the lecture:

Welcome to the presentation on basic addition. I know what you're thinking. 
Sal, addition doesn't seem so basic to me. Well, I apologize. 
Hopefully by the end of this presentation or in a couple weeks it will seem basic. 
So let's get started with, I guess we could say, some problems. 
Well, let's say I start with an old classic. 1 plus 1. 
And I think you already know how to do this, but I'll kind of show you a way of doing this, 
in case you don't have this memorized or you haven't already mastered this. 
You say, well, if I have 1, let's call that an avocado. 
If I have 1 avocado and then you were to give me another avocado, 
how many avocados do I now have? Well, let's see, I have 1, 2 avocados. 
So 1 plus 1 is equal to 2. Now, I know what you're thinking. 
That was too easy, so let me give you something a little bit more difficult. 
I like the avocados. I might stick with that theme. What is 3 plus 4? Hmm, this is, 
I think, a more difficult problem. Well, let's stick with the avocados. 
And in case you don't know what an avocado is, it's actually a very delicious fruit. 
It's actually the fattiest of all the fruits. You probably didn't even think it was a fruit, 
even if you ate one. So let's say I have 3 avocados. 1, 2, 3, right? 1, 2, 3. 
And let's say you were to give me 4 more avocados. Let me put this 4 in yellow so you 
know that these are the ones you're giving me. 1, 2, 3, 4. So how many total avocados do I have now? 
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 avocados. So 3 plus 4 is equal to 7. And now I'm going to introduce you
 to another way of thinking about this. It's called the number line. Actually, I think this is how I do
  it in my head when I forget, if I don't have it memorized. So number line, I just write all the numbers
   in order, and I go high enough just so all the numbers I'm using are kind of in it. So you know the first number is
    0, which is nothing. Maybe you don't know, but now you know. And then you go to 1, 2, 3, 3
    , 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Keeps going, 11. So we're saying 3 plus 4. So let's start 
    at 3. So I have 3 here. And we're going to add 4 to that 3. So all we do is we go up the number line,
     or we go to the right on the number line, 4 more. So we go 1, 2, 3, 4. Notice all we did is we just increased
      it by 1, by 2, by 3, by 4, and then we ended up at 7. And that was our answer. We could do a couple of different ones. We could say, what if I asked you what 8 plus 1 is? Well, you might already know that plus 1 is just the next number, but if we look at the number line, you start at 8 and you add 1. 8 plus 1 is equal to
       9. Let's do some harder problems. And just so you know, if you're a little daunted by this initially, you can always draw the circles, you can always do the number line. And eventually over time, the more practice you do, you'll hopefully memorize these and you'll do these problems in like half a second. I promise you, you just got to keep practicing. Let's say, I want to draw the number line again. Actually, I have a line tool, so I shouldn't give you all those ugly looking lines that I've been giving you. Look at that. That's amazing. Wait, let me see. Oh, yeah, look at that. OK, so that's a nice looking line. I'm going to feel bad to erase it later on. So let me draw a number line. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. So let's do a hard problem. What is 5 plus 6? So if you want, you could pause the video and try this. You might already know the answer. And the reason why I say this is a hard problem is because the answer has more numbers than figures, so you can't necessarily do it on your fingers. So let's get started with this problem. Actually, my phone is ringing, but I'm going to ignore the phone because you're more important. OK, let's start at the 5. So we start at the 5, and we're going to add 6 to it. So we go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. We're at 11. So 5 plus 6 is equal to 11. Now I'm going to ask you a question. What is 6 plus 5?
        Huh. Well, we're not going to see that. Can you switch the two numbers and get the same answer? Well, let's try that. I'm going to try it in a different color so we don't get all confused. So let's start at 6, right? Ignore the yellow for now, and add 5 to it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Huh, we get to the same place. And I think you might want to try this on a bunch of problems, and you'll see it always works out, that it doesn't matter what order you add. 5 plus 6 is the same thing as 6 plus 5. And that makes sense. If I have 5 avocados and you give me 6, I'm going to have 11, if I have 6 avocados and you gave me 5, I'm going to have 11, either way. Let's do a couple, since this number line is so nice, I want to do a few more problems using it. Although, as I use it, I'm sure I'll just continue to confuse you, because I'll write so much on top of it. But let's see. I'll use white now. What is 8 plus 7? Well, if you can still read this, 8 is right here, right? We're going to add 7 to it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. We go to 15. 8 plus 7 is 15. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how to do these types of problems. And more than, I guess, this, and you're going to learn multiplication a little bit, but these types of problems are, when you're getting started off in mathematics, these kind of require the most practice. And to some degree, you have to start memorizing them. But over time, when you look back, I want you to remember how you feel while you're watching this video right now. And then, I want you to watch this video in like three years, and remember how you felt when you're watching it now. And you're going to be, oh my god, this was so easy, because you're going to learn it so fast. So anyway, I think you have an idea. If you don't know the answer to any of the addition problems that we give in the exercises, you can press the hints, and it'll draw circles, and then you can just count up the circles. Or if you want to do it on your own, so you get the problem right, you could draw the circles, or you could draw a number line, like we did in this presentation. I think you might be ready to tackle the addition problems. Have fun.

Cool make more on this lecture:
Here's the transcript of the lecture:

Welcome to the video on basic subtraction. Let's do a little bit of review of basic addition first. If I said 4 plus 3, what did this mean? 4 plus 3. What did that equal? Well, there were a couple of ways we could have viewed this. We could have said I had 4 of something. Let's say I had 4 circles or, I don't know, I had 4 lemons for breakfast. So 1, 2, 3, 4 lemons for breakfast. And let's say I had another 3 lemons for lunch. 1, 2, 3. And so you could view 4 plus 3 as how many total lemons did I have? I'm adding 3 to 4. So how many total did I have? Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So I had a total of 7 lemons. Another way we could have viewed that is we could have drawn our number line. I'll draw it in yellow because that's not wide enough. I'll draw it in yellow because we're talking about lemons. So let's say that's our number line. And if I start at the number, let me draw all of the numbers. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So you could think about this as saying, well, we're on the number line. We start at the number 4. That's this number 4. And we're adding 3 to it. So we'll increase along the number line by 3. So we'll go 1, 2, 3. And you end up at 7. You could say if I have 4 and I get 3 more, I get 7. Or if I increase 4 by 3, I also get 7. So what's subtraction now? Because that's what this video's about. I shouldn't waste all of our time talking about addition. So let's take the example of 4 minus 3. What does that equal to? Let me switch colors just to keep things interesting. So what is 4 minus 3 equal to? Subtraction, or minus, is the opposite of addition. So in addition, you're doing something more. You're adding. I don't want to use the word adding to define addition. But that's what you're doing. I had 4 lemons and then I had 3 more. In subtraction, you're taking away. So this example, if I started with 4 lemons, let's say I had 4 lemons on a plate, if I'm subtracting 3, if I'm saying minus 3, instead of adding these 3 here and getting 7, I'm going to take 3 away. So maybe I'm eating them or maybe I'm giving them to you in exchange for watching these videos. So to take away 3 from this 4, let's say this one goes away, this one goes away, and this one goes away. How many lemons would we have left? Well, this is the only one that I haven't crossed out, so we would have 1 lemon left. And this would be the lemon that's left. It didn't have to be that one. I could have crossed out any of the 3. Another way to view that, let's draw the same lemon-colored number line. Let's say that this is the number line right here. And I'll draw all the same numbers. So that's 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Of course, the number line keeps going. There's no largest number you can imagine. Any number that you can think of, I can think of one higher than that. So there is no largest number, so that's why we draw that arrow there. I could never draw the entire number line. But anyway, back to subtraction. So we're starting at 4 lemons, right? When we added 3, plus 3, we went to the right 4 spaces on the number line. And that's because the right is increasing value. So we went from 4 to 5. That was 1 more. 5 to 6 was 2 more. And 7 was 3 more. Now we're taking away from 4. So what do we do? What would you think we do? Well, since we're taking away, we're going to decrease the total number of lemons we have. So we take away 1. We get to 3. Take away 2. Get to 2. Take away 3. We took away 3, right? So we'll go back 1, 2, 3 along the number line, and we'll end up at 1. And that's this one right here. So just to review, addition is you're doing more of something. Subtraction is you are taking away. If you think about it on the number line, addition is increasing along the number line by that amount. So in this case, we increased along the number line by 3. And so we went from 4 to 7. In the subtraction case, we decrease back on the number line. So we decrease by the amount that you're subtracting. So in this case, we decreased by 3. So we went back 1, 2, 3, and we had 1. And the other way to view it, if I have 4 or something, if I give 3 away, or if I ate 3 of them, or if I don't know what I did to 3 of them, or if I lost 3 of them, I would have 1 left. Now let me show you some interesting things about subtraction. So we know that 4 minus 3 is equal to 1. Let me show you something else that's interesting. What is 4 minus 1? Well, we could use either example. Let's do the lemon example. Let's do apples now. I'm bored of the lemons. Let's add 1, 2, 3, 4. I have a new pen. Sometimes it doesn't draw right. Let's add 4 apples. This is the example we're dealing with. And I were to eat 1 of them. So 1 of them were to go away. How many apples would I have left? Well, 3. 1, 2, 3. So 4 minus 1 is equal to 3. And if we did it on the number line, if we started at 4, and we subtracted 1, we took 1 away, so we're going to become 1 smaller. We go back 1, we get 3. Either way works. But isn't this interesting? 4 minus 3 is equal to 1, and 4 minus 1 is equal to 3. You might say, well, did I pick the numbers just so it worked? Well, it turns out that it's always true. I don't want to get too technical, but we're already touching on something that you'll learn later on, maybe in algebra one day. But actually, I don't want to go into that right now. So where does this come from? Well, this is also based on the fact that 3 plus 1. I didn't want to confuse you, so I apologize if I did. But I'll show you another interesting thing. What is 3 plus 1? 3 plus 1 is equal to what? Well, that's easy. You know that from basic addition. You can start at the number line at 3 and add 1 to it. And you end up at 4. 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. Or you could have started at 1 on the number line and added 3. 1, 2, 3. And you would have also ended up at 4, right? So we also know that you could have switched this either way. Both of those are equal to 4. What do you see here? Well, there's a bunch of things I've written here, and they all kind of relate to each other. 1 plus 3 is equal to 4. 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. 4 minus 1 is 3. Essentially, 4 minus 1 and getting 3 is the exact same. You're saying the same thing as 3 plus 1 is equal to 4. This statement says if I add 1 to 3, I get 4. This is saying if I take away 1 from 4, I get 3. So if I start at 4 and move back, I get 3. This is saying if I start at 3 and I move up 1, I get 4. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit of intuition about what subtraction is. In the next video, I'll just do as many basic subtraction problems I can do in 10 minutes, and then you'll be ready to do the exercises. See you soon.
